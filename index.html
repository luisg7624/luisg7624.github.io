    <h1>My Background</h1>
      <p id="BG">I hail from the Southern Bronx and I attend KIPP NYC College Prep. I participate in a multitude of activities in which I ABSOLUTLY and TOTALLY dominate in. All the females are interested in me in both a social and sexual way, and all the teachers dab me up when I flawlessly pass my exams. </p>
